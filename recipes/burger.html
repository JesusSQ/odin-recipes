    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Ground chuck</li>
            <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic and onion powder</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, 
                crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and 
                spices. Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the 
                mixture is very smooth.</li>
            <li>press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a 
                knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 
                – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle 
                patties.</li>
            <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold
                 the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press 
                 firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically
                  want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns 
                  they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink a bit in the 
                  cooking process.</li>
            <li>preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 
                350-400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium 
                burger.</li>
            <li>Stack the hot patties on hamburger buns, and dress up with your 
                favorite hamburger toppings and condiments.</li>
        </ol>
